# The Charity Public License

Charity is a public `LICENSE` for open software that brings the approach of MIT and BSD licenses into the twenty-first century.  Parity makes your software free to use by almost anyone.

Charity is based on [The Parity Public License](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license), which shares many of the same terms.  Charity is a "free for everybody" license.  Parity is a "free for open source" license.

## Comparing

Charity improves on previous permissive licenses in several ways.

1.  Charity is written to be read, in plain language, with a simple "here's your permission, and here are the rules" structure.  The whole license fits on 26 lines of 65 columns.

2.  Charity gives explicit patent permission, with a patent-termination clause, like Apache 2.0, but without its wordiness.

3.  Charity helps others find your source code and contribute back, by requiring that users keep a notice about where to find source, in addition to your copyright notice.
